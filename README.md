### About Password Strength

Traditionally, passwords are recommended to be created with fully random letters, numbers and special l, such as “!T7m@C:#”. While the password is strong, it is almost impossible to memorize. When forgetting passwords and rejected by online services, users often feel frustrated and choose very simplified and predictable passwords instead, resulting in more vulnerable passwords. The drawback for such rule outweighs its benefits. To address this issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advocates memorable passwords in the new guideline (SP 800-63B). It recommends less complex but still lengthy and random passwords to increase password usability while maintaining strength. One way to achieve this is by the combination of more than 4 random vocabularies. It could be easier to memorize while preserving the length and randomness of the passwords. The rule is illustrated as webcomics by XKCA in the following figure.
